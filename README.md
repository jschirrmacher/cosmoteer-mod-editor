# cosmoteer-mod-editor
Editor for mods of Cosmoteer (see https://cosmoteer.net)

The syntax of Cosmoteer mods is regrettably unintuitive and not well documented. So, the goal of this project is to make
it easier to setup own mods or modify existing ones by reducing at least some common mistakes seen when editing the
files with a normal text editor.

This project is currently in its start phase, so it is not fully functional. If you like to participate in development,
please get in touch!
