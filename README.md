# cosmoteer-mod-editor
Editor for mods of Cosmoteer (see https://cosmoteer.net)

The syntax of Cosmoteer mods is quite difficult to learn, as it is not well documented. Further mistakes are easily done, as the keywords can easily be misspelled. So, the goal of this project is to make
it easier to setup own mods or modify existing ones by reducing at least some common mistakes seen when editing the
files with a normal text editor.

In future the editor should allow easy combining of the different objects which make a mod file.

This project is currently in its start phase, so it is not fully functional. If you like to participate in development,
